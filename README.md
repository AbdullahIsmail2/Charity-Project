## Project Description

collaborate closely with them, to understand their needs and vision for the website. They wanted a mutli-page website with easy navigation to allow for smooth user experience. In this project i enhaced the following skills.

 - The development process included translating the client's requirements into efficient code while adhering to modern design principles. 
- Feedback sessions with the client were held regularly to ensure that the final product met their expectations.
- I also conducted user testing to ensure the website is user-friendly and intuitive
- I had to learn React Router for this project, demonstrating my adaptability and flexib abilty to work with projects outside of my skillset by being willing to learn new technolgies and features

The project also required working under tight deadlines to deliver the website within the specified timeframe.
